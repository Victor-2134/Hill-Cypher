The encryption matrix and the characters used for encryption is given in the first few lines on the encryption file.The code takes these in from the file, so no need to enter the matrix and the characters again.
Also the decrypted file is created as a new file in the name of "Decrypted.txt"

In the "Encrypted_File.txt" file,I have used 73 characters for encrypting (corresponding to serial numbers 0,1,2,..., 72).
 (There is space character  in between "9" and "A". Note that the final character is invisible being newline character corresponding  to ENTER key on the keyboard. If that character is not included then the whole file would look like single line!)
 

You will also find the 4x4 encryption matrix used (it is shown as 2-dimensional Python list).
Actual data to be encrypted starts from the 6th line.

If you are using your own characters, encryption matrix, encrypted data, just change those parts in the "Encrypted_File.txt" file according to your needs.
